# Rotate 2D Matrix
## Objective

The rotate_2d_matrix function rotates a given 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, useful in applications like image processing and game development.

## Prerequisites

    Python 3.x

## Installation
No special installation required. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

## Usage

    Run the main.py function as indicated below.
    
```bash
$ ./main_0.py
[[7, 4, 1],
[8, 5, 2],
[9, 6, 3]]
```

## Description
Matrix Representation in Python

2D matrices are represented using lists of lists. Elements are accessed and modified via indexing, e.g., matrix[row][column].
In-place Operations

Performing operations without creating a copy modifies the original structure. This minimizes space complexity, crucial for large matrices.
Matrix Transposition

Transposing a matrix swaps rows and columns. It's a key step in rearranging elements for rotation.
Reversing Rows in a Matrix

Reversing row order is essential for achieving the 90-degree rotation. It completes the transformation started by transposition.
Nested Loops

Nested loops iterate through 2D matrices. They allow element modification necessary for the rotation.
